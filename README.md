# Strategic Investment
## Overview
Welcome to Strategic Investment, a platform that combines decentralized finance (DeFi) with machine learning to empower users in creating and managing Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategies for a diverse basket of tokens. Our inspiration stems from the growing interest in DeFi and the need for a seamless integration of machine learning algorithms and decentralized platforms for strategic and automated investment practices.

## Inspiration
Our project is motivated by the desire to offer users a powerful tool that enables them to engage in strategic and automated investment practices in the world of decentralized finance. We recognized the need for a platform that seamlessly integrates machine learning algorithms and a decentralized infrastructure to facilitate the creation and management of DCA strategies for a diverse range of tokens.

## What It Does
Strategic Investment allows users to:

- Select a basket of tokens that are categorize based on statistical metrics such as VaR, Alpha, Beta, and Sharpe Ratio.
- Create personalized DCA strategies.
- Choose a stable coin for selling token holdings.
- Rely on smart contracts for automated execution.
## How We Built It
Our platform is built on a foundation of cutting-edge technologies:

- Smart Contracts: We implemented a smart contract that facilitates token swapping at optimal times.
- 0x APIs: We utilize 0x APIs for efficient and secure swapping of stable tokens within the required basket.
- Machine Learning Models: Token categorization is achieved through machine learning models trained using historical data, seamlessly integrated into the platform's backend. By analyzing the trend and forecasting the future returns.
- Frontend Design: The frontend is meticulously designed to provide users with an intuitive interface for strategy customization and monitoring.
